## Overview

Python has many elegant features that can show the difference between a “programmer who uses Python” and a true “Pythonista”

Pythonista may be a silly word but it’s a real thing. A true pythonista is able to leverage the particular features of Python to accomplish a task in a simpler and more easy to reason about way.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

Create examples demonstrating pythonic language features. For example…
Use iterators/generators on a custom collection to…
add ability to be used in a for in loop
add ability to be used in a list comprehension
add ability to convert to a list or other collection type
Create a decorator that adds behavior to a given function. For example…
Calculate the time spent in the function
Log relevant info for debugging purposes
Slow down the function
Convert the return value in some way
Validate some condition on the way in
Use dunder methods make your code more readable and elegant. For example…
add ability for two custom data structure to be considered equal
add ability for custom data structure to be considered truthy/falsy
Anything else that catches your interest

## Implementation Notes

Describe your findings in README
Optionally create your project as a Jupyter Notebook if you prefer
In that case add tests as asserts within Notebook

### Stretch Goals

- Hook up Next.js app with your Django Rest Framework API.
- Deploy a preview build (include URL in README)
- Use a competing host.

### User Acceptance Tests

Create unit tests to demonstrate the features you select.

## Configuration

create a pythonisms repository on GitHub.
Use poetry to initialize project.
$ poetry init -n

Use the folder created by Poetry as the root of your project’s git repository.

----

Getting Started Clone this repository to your local machine.

$ git clone Link Once downloaded, activate your virtual environment and run by ____________

poetry init poetry shell
