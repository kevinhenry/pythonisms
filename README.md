Deployed on: [Link](https://github.com/kevinhenry/pythonisms)

PR: [Link](https://github.com/kevinhenry/nextjs-geissele/pull/2)

Collaboration: Tony Regalado, Anthony Williams

## Overview

It’s time to go live with your front end!

There are a lot of great (and cheap) deployment options. One of the best is Vercel

The Vercel platform was built by creators of Next.js so it’s bound to be good.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

[x] Refer to Deploying Your Next.js App
[x] Deploy your Next.js app.
    [x] An app you build fresh just for this lab.
    [] The app you built for previous lab.
    [] Convert one of your “vanilla” React app’s to Next.js
    [] Really, anything.
    [] As long as you created it with Next.js

## Implementation Notes

- You’ll need a Vercel account and to link it to Github.
    - The Deployment instructions above will walk you through it.

### Stretch Goals

- Hook up Next.js app with your Django Rest Framework API.
- Deploy a preview build (include URL in README)
- Use a competing host.

### User Acceptance Tests

No automated testing today.

## Configuration

- Create Github repository with your choice of name
    - Choose something you like because it will be the default name of your deployed app.
-Submit pull request to completed project.
-Customize README.md for your app.
    - Include deployed URL in README

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
